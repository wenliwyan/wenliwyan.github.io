title: Manipulating Data with Labels in pandas
---
pandas is probably the most widely used Python package for handling tabular data. Although I hated using pandas for quite some time (fun fact) due to its cumbersome usage (for example, get a flavor of it from [pandas user guide: miscellaneous indexing faq](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#miscellaneous-indexing-faq) and [real python: SettingWithCopyWarning](https://realpython.com/pandas-settingwithcopywarning/#use-of-views-and-copies-in-pandas)) compared to the straightforward transformations achievable with NumPy arrays, my perspective shifted over time. I came to recognize its strengths, particularly when confronted with CSV files. From my perspective, pandas' defining feature lies in its use of labels. Unlike NumPy arrays, where manipulating elements requires numeric indices devoid of semantic meaning, pandas utilizes row and column labels that provide explicit meaning to the data, thereby preventing users from getting lost in mere numbers.

While I maintain a preference for NumPy to execute array transformations, the utilization of pandas becomes essential when working with labels. This post serves as a repository for the practical applications that I have collected while working with pandas labels, offering a convenient reference for future.

## pandas.Index

[pandas.Index](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Index.html) is the data structure to store a series of labels in pandas. For row labels, the `pandas.Index` object is called `index`, and for column labels, it's called `columns` (as shown in the code example below). Note that index becomes an overloaded term here. To differentiate them clearly, this post adds `pandas.` prefix explicitly when referring to the class underlying both row and column labels, and use index directly when referring to row labels.

```python
In : df = pd.DataFrame({"unit": ["a", "a", "b", "c", "c"],
                        "time": [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
                        "value": [10, 15, 5, 8, 12]})

In : df  # df will be also used in code examples later
Out: 
  unit  time  value
0    a     0     10
1    a     1     15
2    b     1      5
3    c     0      8
4    c     1     12

In : df.index
Out: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=5, step=1)

In : df.columns  
Out: Index(['unit', 'time', 'value'], dtype='object')
```

**Subclass.**  In certain use cases, subclasses of `pandas.Index` are available to optimize memory usage and improve computing speed. Notable examples include [`RangeIndex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.RangeIndex.html) for monotonic integer labels, and [`MultiIndex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.MultiIndex.html) for multi-level labels.

**Attributes.**  Member variables in `pandas.Index` class include:
* `name`: str, the name (category) of all labels
* `names`: pandas `FrozenList` of str, the name (category) of all labels in each level. The length of names equals the number of levels.
* `values`: NumPy ndarray, the actual labels

```python
In : print(df.columns.name)
None

In : df.columns.names
Out: FrozenList([None])

In : df.columns.values
Out: array(['unit', 'time', 'value'], dtype=object)
```

Like the code example above, `name` and `names` are usually empty, unless explicitly set in order to provide more semantic meaning. An example with concrete names be found latter in MultiIndex section.

### data selection by labels

`loc` uses labels to access data. Contrarily, `iloc` uses positions to access data. See details in [pandas user guide: indexing and selecting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing).

## index

This section expands further for row labels specifically.

When creating a [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame) (2-dimensional data) or a [`Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html#pandas.Series) (1-dimensional data), if the input data contains no indexing information and index is not explicitly provided either, its index defaults to `RangeIndex`.

**Set Index.**  The index of a DataFrame can be changed by `DataFrame.set_index(keys)`. Providing a column name instructs using an existing column as index. The old index gets completely replaced (unless specify `append=True` in which case the new index are combined with the old index forming a multi-level index).

```python
In : df.set_index("unit")
Out: 
      time  value
unit             
a        0     10
a        1     15
b        1      5
c        0      8
c        1     12

In : multi_index_df = df.set_index(["unit", "time"])
In : multi_index_df  # multi_index_df will be also used in code examples later
Out: 
           value
unit time       
a    0        10
     1        15
b    1         5
c    0         8
     1        12
```

Note that even though index is generally expected to be unique for efficient data retrieval, `pandas.Index` does not enforce the uniqueness constraint (as shown in the first example above). It's important to understand what you are doing and pre-process the column as needed before setting it as index, because removing duplicated index in a DataFrame afterwards is not very straightforward ([ref](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-drop-duplicated-index-in-a-pandas-dataframe-a-complete-guide/#how-to-drop-duplicated-index-in-a-pandas-dataframe)).

```python
In : df.set_index("unit", verify_integrity=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Index has duplicate keys: Index(['a', 'c'], dtype='object', name='unit')
```

**Reindex.**  If the new index does not come directly from an existing column name, explicitly specify the new index to replace the old index by assigning `DataFrame.index` directly or calling `DataFrame.reindex(index)`. The benefit of the latter one is it allows different lengths between the old and the new index with its filling logic to add missing values, while the first one throws ValueError complaining length mismatch. An example of `DataFrame.reindex(index)` can be found later in the MultiIndex section, where a multi-level index is expanded to be the full cartesian product of labels from each level of it, and missing values are labelled NA (by default) for the added labels.

**Reset Index.**  To change back to the default sequential numerical index `RangeIndex`, `DataFrame.reset_index()` is used. The default adds the old index as a column with the index name (if the index name is empty, the new column name is set to "index"). In use cases such as numerical index becomes nuisance after filtering or reordering the rows, set `drop=True` parameter to completely drop the old index.

```python
In : df[df["time"] == 1]  # index is useless after filtering rows
Out: 
  unit  time  value
1    a     1     15
2    b     1      5
4    c     1     12

In : df[df["time"] == 1].reset_index()  # index becomes a column by default
Out: 
   index unit  time  value
0      1    a     1     15
1      2    b     1      5
2      4    c     1     12

In : df[df["time"] == 1].reset_index(drop=True)
Out: 
  unit  time  value
0    a     1     15
1    b     1      5
2    c     1     12

In : df.sort_values(by="value", ignore_index=True)  # ignore_index introduced in pandas version >1.0
# equivalent to df.sort_values(by="value").reset_index(drop=True)
Out:
  unit  time  value
0    b     1      5
1    c     0      8
2    a     0     10
3    c     1     12
4    a     1     15
```

## MultiIndex

`MultiIndex` is the subclass of `pandas.Index` for multi-level labels. It can be used for both row and column labels.

To create a DataFrame with multi-level index, you can use `set_index` to set multiple columns as the index. To directly construct a `MultiIndex` object, you can use its class functions to construct it from arrays, tuples, and products (see [pandas user guide: MultiIndex / advanced indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#creating-a-multiindex-hierarchical-index-object)).

Following the example of `multi_index_df` from `set_index` section:

```python
In : multi_index_df
Out: 
           value
unit time       
a    0        10
     1        15
b    1         5
c    0         8
     1        12

In : multi_index_df.index.levels  # levels are member variable in MultiIndex but not in Index
Out: FrozenList([['a', 'b', 'c'], [0, 1]])

In : multi_index_df.index.values
Out: array([('a', 0), ('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 0), ('c', 1)], dtype=object)

In : expanded_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(multi_index_df.index.levels, names=["unit", "time"])

In : expanded_index.levels
Out: FrozenList([['a', 'b', 'c'], [0, 1]])

In : expanded_index.values  # label ('b', 0) is newly added
Out: 
array([('a', 0), ('a', 1), ('b', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 0), ('c', 1)], dtype=object)

In : expanded_df = multi_index_df.reindex(expanded_index)

In : expanded_df
Out: 
           value
unit time       
a    0      10.0
     1      15.0
b    0       NaN
     1       5.0
c    0       8.0
     1      12.0
```

To get the labels for all data at one specific level, use `MultiIndex.get_level_values(level)` by providing its integer position or its level name. Note that the result verbosely displays all labels exactly as the order they appear in the data, while `MultiIndex.levels[level_idx]` shows a de-duplicated list and does not necessarily show labels according to the order that they appear in the data. Therefore, slicing tricks may be needed on the verbose list of labels in order to keep the correct order in the de-duplicated list (as shown in the last block in the below code example).

```python
In : import numpy as np

In : unsorted_expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"unit": ["c", "c", "b", "b", "a", "a"],
    "time": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    "value": [8, 12, np.nan, 5, 10, 15]}
  ).set_index(["unit", "time"])

In : unsorted_expanded_df
Out: 
           value
unit time       
c    0       8.0
     1      12.0
b    0       NaN
     1       5.0
a    0      10.0
     1      15.0

In : unsorted_expanded_df.index.levels[0]
Out: Index(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='object', name='unit')

In : unsorted_expanded_df.index.get_level_values(0)
Out: Index(['c', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a'], dtype='object', name='unit')

In : unsorted_expanded_df.index.get_level_values(0)[::2]  # 2 is len(unsorted_expanded_df.index.levels[1])
Out: Index(['c', 'b', 'a'], dtype='object', name='unit')
```

Note that after slicing a MultiIndex or slicing a DataFrame with MultiIndex, the MultiIndex levels does not re-compute and keep the same defined labels (as defined by pandas `FrozenList`) (see [pandas user guide: ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#defined-levels)), so there could be useless labels that the data subset does not need. In this case, use `MultiIndex.remove_unused_levels()` to clean up the multi-level labels (the func name is a little confusing to me, since it actually removes unused labels in each level - stored in the member variable levels, rather than reduces the number of levels).

```python
In : sliced = multi_index_df.loc[("a", 1):("b", 1)]

In : sliced
Out: 
           value
unit time       
a    1        15
b    1         5

In : sliced.index.levels  # the defined labels in each level keep unchanged after slicing
Out: FrozenList([['a', 'b', 'c'], [0, 1]])

In : sliced.index = sliced.index.remove_unused_levels()

In : sliced.index.levels
Out: FrozenList([['a', 'b'], [1]])
```
